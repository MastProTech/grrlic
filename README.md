This is Neil a.k.a. _`grrlic`_. TL;DR, I am a super curious person in learning new technologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently trying to utilize my spare time to work on some interesting small projects, preferably simple **API** x data analytics microservices rather than fullstack (Frontend + Backend), meanwhile using the languages that I've been learning for quite some time like `Python`, `Golang` and `Scala`. These projects might revolve around algorithmic field, and I am thinking to add some machine learning elements as well, such as emotions analyzer (NLP) _maybe?_ Who knows ..Ï†(ãƒ»âˆ€ãƒ»ï¼Š)
- ðŸ‘¯ While doing personal side-projects is as fun, I'm looking for experiences in tech-integrated industries (finance, e-commerce) and definitely **#OpenToWork**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to machine learning, data, and even **algorithms**, really happy to collaborate ![](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/grrlic?label=Twitter&style=social)

Meanwhile, I plan to actively maintain my personal **[blog](https://grrlic.xyz)** and I as well pretty active here on Github.
