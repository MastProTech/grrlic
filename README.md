This is Neil. Just a bit of spoiler, I am a super curious person in learning new technologies.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **data** analytics _RESTful_ **API**, made with **Python** and R (still considering)
- ðŸŒ± Learning is an infinite loop, and I'm currently focusing especially on NLP, _natural language processing_, and 've been doing well thanks to Stanford's and MIT's open courses
- ðŸ‘¯ While doing personal side-projects is as fun, I'm looking for experiences in tech-integrated industries (finance, e-commerce) and definitely **#OpenToWork**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to machine learning, data, and even **algorithms**, really happy to collaborate ![](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/grrlic?label=Twitter&style=social)

Meanwhile, I plan to actively maintain my personal **[blog](https://grrlic.xyz)** and I as well pretty active here on Github, also on **[CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/grrlic)** and **[CodeChef](https://codechef.com/users/grrlic)**.
